# THE WHEEL OF STANDUP

## WHAT...

...is it? A spinning wheel to inform who's turn it is to go during Standups

## WHY...

...did it get made? Because we spent too long determining who had to go next.

## HOW...

...do I run it locally?

Clone the repo and `cd` into it.  Then:

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

Then enter the team members' names and SPIN THE WHEEL.

The rules state that you have to chant "SPIN! THE! WHEEL!" for maximum effect.
